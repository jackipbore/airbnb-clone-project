# airbnb-clone-project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.
# Team Roles
Backend Developer
Responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic, APIs, and integration with databases and third-party services. Ensures the system runs smoothly, securely, and efficiently.

Database Administrator (DBA)
Manages database design, implementation, performance tuning, and security. Ensures data integrity, backups, and high availability of the database system.

Frontend Developer
Develops the user interface and ensures a seamless user experience across different devices and browsers. Translates design mockups into interactive web pages.

DevOps Engineer
Sets up CI/CD pipelines, manages infrastructure, monitors system performance, and ensures scalability, security, and automation of deployment processes.

QA Engineer (Quality Assurance)
Designs and performs tests to ensure the software functions as expected. Identifies bugs, monitors resolution, and verifies system reliability before release.

Project Manager
Oversees project planning, timeline, and team coordination. Communicates with stakeholders, manages risks, and ensures timely delivery of milestones.

Technical Writer
Creates and maintains documentation including README files, API references, and user guides. Ensures technical content is clear, concise, and accessible.
# Technology Stack
Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build robust and scalable backend services and RESTful APIs quickly and securely.

PostgreSQL
An open-source relational database management system used for storing and managing structured application data reliably.

GraphQL
A query language for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need, improving efficiency and flexibility.

React
A JavaScript library for building responsive and interactive user interfaces on the frontend.

Docker
A containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies for consistent development and deployment across environments.

Nginx
A high-performance web server and reverse proxy used to serve static files and route traffic to backend services.

GitHub Actions
A CI/CD tool used to automate testing, building, and deployment workflows for the application.
# Database Design
1. Users
Represents individuals who use the platform (e.g., customers, property owners).

id (Primary Key) – Unique identifier

name – Full name of the user

email – Email address (unique)

password_hash – Encrypted password

role – User role (e.g., guest, host, admin)

Relationships:

A user can own multiple properties

A user can make multiple bookings and write reviews

2. Properties
Represents accommodation listings available for booking.

id (Primary Key) – Unique identifier

title – Name or title of the property

description – Detailed description

location – Geographic location

price_per_night – Cost per night

Relationships:

A property belongs to a user (owner)

A property can have multiple bookings and reviews

3. Bookings
Tracks reservations made by users for properties.

id (Primary Key) – Unique identifier

user_id – Foreign key referencing Users

property_id – Foreign key referencing Properties

check_in_date – Date of arrival

check_out_date – Date of departure

Relationships:

A booking is made by one user for one property

4. Reviews
Captures user feedback about properties.

id (Primary Key) – Unique identifier

user_id – Foreign key referencing Users

property_id – Foreign key referencing Properties

rating – Star rating (1–5)

comment – Text feedback

Relationships:

A review is written by a user for a property

5. Payments
Stores information about transactions for bookings.

id (Primary Key) – Unique identifier

booking_id – Foreign key referencing Bookings

amount – Total payment amount

payment_method – e.g., credit card, PayPal

status – e.g., pending, completed, failed

Relationships:

A payment is linked to one booking
# Feature Breakdown
1. User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. The system supports different user roles (e.g., guest, host) with tailored functionalities for each role.

2. Property Management
Enables hosts to list properties by adding details such as title, description, images, location, and pricing. Hosts can also update or remove listings as needed.

3. Booking System
Guests can book available properties by selecting check-in and check-out dates. The system checks availability, calculates total cost, and handles booking confirmations.

4. Review System
After completing a stay, users can rate and review properties. This feature helps maintain trust and transparency between hosts and guests.

5. Payment Integration
Secure payment processing is integrated to handle booking transactions. Users can pay using various methods and receive real-time confirmation of payment status.

6. Search and Filtering
Users can search for properties based on location, price range, availability, and amenities. Filtering options help users quickly find suitable accommodations.

7. Admin Dashboard
Admins have access to manage users, properties, bookings, and payments. It provides visibility and control over platform activity and content moderation.
# API Security
1. Authentication
All users must authenticate using secure methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth before accessing protected endpoints. This ensures that only verified users can interact with sensitive parts of the application, such as managing bookings or payments.

2. Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be enforced to restrict actions based on user roles (e.g., only hosts can create properties, only admins can delete users). This prevents unauthorized actions and maintains system integrity.

3. Rate Limiting
To prevent abuse such as brute-force attacks or DDoS attempts, rate limiting will be applied to API requests. This ensures fair usage and protects backend resources.

4. Data Validation & Sanitization
All input data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). This helps safeguard both the server and other users.

5. HTTPS Enforcement
All API traffic will be served over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. This protects sensitive information like login credentials and payment details from eavesdropping or interception.

Why Security Matters
Protecting User Data: Ensures personal and financial information is secure.

Securing Transactions: Maintains the integrity and trust of the booking and payment system.

Maintaining Platform Trust: Strong security prevents unauthorized access and builds confidence among users and partners.
